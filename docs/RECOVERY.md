# 🆘 SecureVault Recovery Guide

> **⚠️ CRITICAL**: This guide can save your digital life. Bookmark it, print it, memorize it.

## 🎯 Recovery Scenarios

### 🔥 Emergency Recovery Checklist

**Before disaster strikes, ensure you have:**
- [ ] 💾 Recent encrypted backup files
- [ ] 🔑 Master password (memorized or in secure location)
- [ ] 📝 Backup passwords (if different from master)
- [ ] 💿 SecureVault installation files
- [ ] 📋 This recovery guide (printed copy)

## 📱 Scenario 1: Forgot Master Password

### ⚠️ **Reality Check**
```
🔒 UNRECOVERABLE BY DESIGN
========================
If you've forgotten your master password, your data is gone.
This is not a bug - it's a feature that ensures true security.
Even we (the developers) cannot help you recover it.
```

### 🛡️ **Why This Happens**
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Your password never leaves your device
- **No Backdoors**: No recovery keys, no "forgot password" option
- **Military-Grade Security**: Same protection used by intelligence agencies

### 💡 **Prevention Strategies**
```bash
# 1. Use a memorable but strong password
# Good: "MyDog$Name!Is#Buddy2024"
# Bad: "aB3$kL9@mN2%"

# 2. Write it down and store securely
echo "Master Password: [YOUR_PASSWORD]" > password.txt
# Store in: Safe, safety deposit box, trusted family member

# 3. Use a password manager for your password manager
# Store SecureVault password in your brain + backup location
```

## 💻 Scenario 2: Corrupted Vault File

### 🔍 **Symptoms**
- Application won't start
- "Vault file corrupted" error
- Authentication fails with correct password
- File size is 0 bytes or unusually small

### 🛠️ **Recovery Steps**

#### Step 1: Verify Corruption
```bash
# Check file integrity
ls -la vault.enc
file vault.enc

# Expected output:
# vault.enc: data (encrypted)
# Size should be > 1KB for non-empty vaults
```

#### Step 2: Restore from Backup
```bash
# List available backups
ls -la backups/

# Restore from most recent backup
cp backups/vault-backup-2024-01-15.enc vault.enc

# Test restoration
python3 -c "
from app.vault import CredentialVault
vault = CredentialVault()
print('✅ Vault restored successfully' if vault.vault_exists() else '❌ Restoration failed')
"
```

#### Step 3: If No Backups Available
```bash
# Try to recover from temporary files
find /tmp -name "*vault*" -type f 2>/dev/null
find ~/.cache -name "*securevault*" -type f 2>/dev/null

# Check system backups (Linux)
sudo find /var/backups -name "*vault*" 2>/dev/null

# Check Time Machine (macOS)
tmutil listbackups | grep vault
```

---

## 🔥 Scenario 3: Complete System Loss

### 📋 **What You Need**
- New computer/device
- Internet connection (for installation)
- Your encrypted backup file
- Master password or backup password

### 🚀 **Recovery Process**

#### Step 1: Install SecureVault
```bash
# On new system
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/securevault/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Step 2: Restore from Backup
```bash
# Copy backup file to new system
# Via USB, cloud storage, or network transfer

# Restore vault
./scripts/restore.sh --backup /path/to/vault-backup.enc

# Or manually:
cp /path/to/vault-backup.enc vault.enc
```

#### Step 3: Verify Recovery
```bash
# Test access
./start.sh
# Choose CLI interface
# Enter master password
# List credentials to verify
```

## 🌐 Scenario 4: Migration Between Devices

### 📱 **Mobile to Desktop**
```bash
# On mobile device (if supported)
securevault export --format encrypted --output migration.enc

# Transfer file to desktop
# Via email, cloud, or USB

# On desktop
securevault import --file migration.enc
```

### 💻 **Desktop to Desktop**
```bash
# On old computer
python3 -c "
from app.vault import CredentialVault
vault = CredentialVault()
vault.authenticate('your-master-password')
export_data = vault.export_vault('migration-password-123')
with open('migration.enc', 'w') as f: f.write(export_data)
print('✅ Export complete: migration.enc')
"

# Transfer migration.enc to new computer

# On new computer
python3 -c "
from app.vault import CredentialVault
import json

# Create new vault
vault = CredentialVault('new-vault.enc')
vault.create_vault('new-master-password')

# Import old data
with open('migration.enc', 'r') as f:
    export_data = f.read()

# Decrypt and import (manual process)
print('Import migration.enc using the web interface or CLI')
"
```

## 🔄 Scenario 5: Backup File Recovery

### 📁 **Backup File Types**

| File Type | Description | Recovery Method |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `vault-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.enc` | Daily automated backup | Direct restore |
| `vault-export-TIMESTAMP.enc` | Manual export | Import via CLI/Web |
| `migration-DEVICE.enc` | Device migration file | Import process |
| `emergency-backup.enc` | Emergency backup | Special recovery |

### 🔓 **Decrypt Backup File**
```bash
# If you remember the backup password
python3 -c "
import json
import base64
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from app.security import SecurityManager

# Load backup file
with open('vault-backup-2024-01-15.enc', 'r') as f:
    backup_data = f.read()

# Decrypt with backup password
security = SecurityManager()
backup_password = input('Enter backup password: ')

# Decrypt process (simplified)
print('Backup decryption requires the original backup password')
print('If successful, you can restore your vault')
"
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Recovery Techniques

### 🔬 **Forensic Recovery**

#### Recover Deleted Files
```bash
# Linux - recover deleted vault file
sudo apt install testdisk
sudo photorec

# Look for files with .enc extension
# Or files containing "securevault" signature
```

#### Memory Dump Analysis
```bash
# If vault was recently open (Linux)
sudo gcore $(pgrep python3)
strings core.* | grep -A5 -B5 "securevault"

# Look for temporary decrypted data
# WARNING: This is advanced and rarely successful
```

### 🔍 **Log Analysis**
```bash
# Check application logs
tail -100 logs/securevault.log

# Look for:
# - Last successful backup
# - Error messages before corruption
# - Temporary file locations
```

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### 🆘 **Data Breach Response**

If you suspect your vault has been compromised:

```bash
# 1. Immediately change master password
python3 -c "
from app.vault import CredentialVault
vault = CredentialVault()
vault.authenticate('old-master-password')
vault.change_master_password('new-super-secure-password')
print('✅ Master password changed')
"

# 2. Export all credentials
vault.export_vault('emergency-export-password')

# 3. Change all stored passwords
# Use the exported list to update all your accounts

# 4. Create new vault with new master password
mv vault.enc vault-compromised.enc
# Create fresh vault and re-add credentials with new passwords
```

### 🔒 **Secure Destruction**

If you need to securely delete your vault:

```bash
# Secure deletion (Linux/macOS)
shred -vfz -n 3 vault.enc
shred -vfz -n 3 backups/*.enc

# Windows
sdelete -p 3 -s -z vault.enc

# Verify deletion
ls -la vault.enc  # Should show "No such file"
```

## 🎯 Remember

> **"The best recovery plan is the one you never need to use."**

Your vault's security depends on:
1. **Strong master password** (that you remember)
2. **Regular backups** (that you test)
3. **Secure storage** (multiple locations)
4. **Recovery practice** (before you need it)

**🔒 Stay secure, stay prepared!**
