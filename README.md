# Unfortunately, this is unrecoverable by design
# This is a feature, not a bug - true zero-knowledge security
echo "🔒 Your data is truly secure - even from us!"
```

#### 💻 **Scenario 2: Corrupted Vault File**
```bash
# Restore from encrypted backup
./scripts/restore.sh --backup ~/secure-backups/vault-2024-01-15.enc
```

#### 🔥 **Scenario 3: Complete System Loss**
```bash
# Install SecureVault on new system
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/securevault/main/install.sh | bash

# Restore from backup
./scripts/restore.sh --backup /path/to/backup.enc
```

#### 🌐 **Scenario 4: Migration to New Device**
```bash
# Export vault with migration password
python3 -c "
from app.vault import CredentialVault
vault = CredentialVault()
vault.authenticate('your-master-password')
export_data = vault.export_vault('migration-password-123')
with open('migration.enc', 'w') as f: f.write(export_data)
"

# On new device: Import the migration file
python3 -c "
from app.vault import CredentialVault
