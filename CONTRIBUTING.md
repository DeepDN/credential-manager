### 🧪 **Development Environment**

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run development server
./start.sh --dev

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### 🎯 **Code Standards**

#### **Python Code Style**
```python
# Use Black for formatting
black app/ tests/

# Use isort for imports
isort app/ tests/

# Use flake8 for linting
flake8 app/ tests/

# Use mypy for type checking
mypy app/
```

#### **Code Quality Requirements**
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% coverage
- **Type Hints**: All functions must have type hints
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public functions
- **Security**: All security-related code must be reviewed

### 🔒 **Security Requirements**

#### **Security Review Process**
1. All PRs touching security code require security review
2. Cryptographic changes need cryptography expert review
3. New dependencies must be security-audited
4. All security tests must pass

#### **Security Coding Standards**
```python
# ✅ Good: Use secure random for cryptographic purposes
import secrets
salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)

# ❌ Bad: Don't use regular random for security
import random
salt = random.randbytes(16)  # NEVER DO THIS

# ✅ Good: Clear sensitive data from memory
password = get_password()
try:
    # Use password
    process_password(password)
finally:
    # Clear from memory
    password = None
    del password

# ✅ Good: Use constant-time comparison
import hmac
if hmac.compare_digest(provided_hash, expected_hash):
    # Authenticated
```

### 🧪 **Testing Requirements**

#### **Test Categories**
```bash
# Unit tests - fast, isolated
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Integration tests - test component interaction
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Security tests - cryptography and security features
pytest tests/security/ -v

# Performance tests - benchmarks and load testing
pytest tests/performance/ -v --benchmark-only
```

#### **Test Coverage Requirements**
- **Overall**: >90% line coverage
- **Security modules**: >95% line coverage
- **New features**: 100% line coverage
- **Bug fixes**: Must include regression test

### 📝 **Documentation Standards**

#### **Code Documentation**
```python
def encrypt_credential(data: str, key: bytes) -> bytes:
    """
    Encrypt credential data using AES-256-GCM.
    
    Args:
        data: The credential data to encrypt
        key: 256-bit encryption key derived from master password
        
    Returns:
        Encrypted data as bytes
        
    Raises:
        EncryptionError: If encryption fails
        
    Security:
        Uses AES-256-GCM for authenticated encryption.
        Each encryption uses a unique random IV.
    """
```

#### **API Documentation**
- All endpoints must have OpenAPI documentation
- Include request/response examples
- Document error codes and responses
- Security considerations for each endpoint

## 🎯 Coding Best Practices

### 🔒 **Security Best Practices**

```python
# Input Validation
def validate_password(password: str) -> bool:
    """Validate password meets security requirements."""
    if len(password) < 8:
        raise ValueError("Password too short")
    # Additional validation...
    return True

# Error Handling - Don't leak information
try:
    authenticate_user(username, password)
except AuthenticationError:
    # Don't reveal whether username or password was wrong
    raise AuthenticationError("Invalid credentials")

# Logging - Don't log sensitive data
logger.info(f"User {username} logged in")  # ✅ OK
logger.info(f"Password: {password}")       # ❌ NEVER
```

### ⚡ **Performance Best Practices**

```python
# Use generators for large datasets
def get_all_credentials():
    for credential in vault.credentials:
        yield credential

# Cache expensive operations
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def derive_key(password: str, salt: bytes) -> bytes:
    # Expensive key derivation
    return pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode(), salt, 100000)

# Use async for I/O operations
async def backup_vault():
    async with aiofiles.open('backup.enc', 'wb') as f:
        await f.write(encrypted_data)
```
